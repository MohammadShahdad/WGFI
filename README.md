# Winter Games Federation of India Webpage

## Introduction
**WGFI**  is a defunct federation which used to govern the winter sports events held in India. I started this project in 2017 while the federation was still operational and the motivation behind it was that their current webpage had a really bad design that you can see for yourself [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170106235903/http://www.wgfi.in/). So I decided to do my part as a skier and programmer and build a new website for them. However during the development process the organization was made defunct and hence I never finished this project to the extent that I wanted to.

You can access this webpage from the below links.
